            <p>Minion & Greek.
              Gerry Leonidas, University of Reading, October 2017.
            <p>
            <p>For Minion 3, Slimbach has created a completely ne w version of the Greek, giving it the historically accurate reverse pen stress that characterizes written Greek, and adding polytonic letters in addition to monotonic.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="bigsentence" id="anchor31">
            <div class="bigsentencetwo" id="culturebigsentence">
            <p>The default forms are triangular, which are in tune with Minion’s humanist roots. (Minion 3 also includes alternates for letters whose shapes are derived from El and De.)</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="cyrillicsection" id="anchor32">

            <div id="asideimg">
              <p>Minion made an immediate impression on its initial release thanks to the detail work that Slimbach put into the typographic niceties</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="cyrillictext" id="anchor33">
            <p>Minion’s original Greek, with its more Western directional stress, was released as part of Minion Pro in 2000, and has been used successfully for more than a decade and still works well. Minion 3 offers this original pen stress as a stylistic set. The difference is only in the lowercase, where pen stress is most pronounced; <span class="tempdisplaynone">the capitals of both versions are identical. Consultant Gerry Leonidas says that, “in many ways, the first Minion Pro set the reference point for a whole series of subsequent modulated Greek typefaces.”</span></p>

        <div  class="Csection" id="anchor34">
        <div class="Csectionone">
          <p>The possibilities in Greek type design have expanded in the ensuing decade and a half, which makes Minion Greek “perhaps the most fitting typeface to revisit,” according to Leonidas. “It marked a significant stage in the course of Greek typeface development, but also carried the signs of its being a very early step in this process.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Csectiontwo">
          <p>In approaching a new version of the Greek lowercase for Minion, Slimbach had to find a way to incorporate the “reversed ductus” – or direction of stress within the letters – that was seen in early Greek types, which derived from the handwriting of Greek scholars during the Italian Renaissance.<span class="tempdisplaynone"> While keeping the reversed stress, he aimed to achieve “a very pure and principled traditional style, approaching the level of refinement present in the Latin.”</span></p>
