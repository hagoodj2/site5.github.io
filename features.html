              <p>When Minion was first released in 1990, publisher David Godine, who is known for his fine book work and his classical sensibility, was quoted as calling Minion “an elegant and useful addition to the library of classic typefaces, stronger than Bembo but just as graceful, even in weight and color, with an italic that has genuine personality and sparkle.” <span class="tempdisplaynone">In the nearly 30 years since then, Minion’s promise has been fulfilled in a host of books and publications where it has become one of the most elegant of the workhorse text typefaces.</span></p>

            <div class="Stextonetwo" id="anchor15">
              <p>With Minion 3, Slimbach had the opportunity to re-examine the Minion family and to extend it further. He has greatly extended the Latin glyph set, nearly doubling the number of glyphs and covering pretty much any language written in the Latin alphabet, including African languages and Vietnamese, as well as full IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) support.<span class="tempdisplaynone"> He has also refined both the Cyrillic and the Greek extensively (even adding a second Greek style), and introduced a new script: Armenian.</span></p>

            <p>Slimbach has also made subtle but significant changes to Minion’s optical sizes, especially the smaller ones. These changes not only improve the appearance and function of Minion for text today, but anticipate the creation of a variable-font version of Minion, where optical sizes will be able to change dynamically and fluidly.<span class="tempdisplaynone"> Minion 3’s optical sizes extend across the entire typeface — including the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, and IPA scripts.</span></p>

            <p>Minion’s original Greek, with its more Western directional stress, was released as part of Minion Pro in 2000, and has been used successfully for more than a decade and still works well. Minion 3 offers this original pen stress as a stylistic set. The difference is only in the lowercase, where pen stress is most pronounced; the capitals of both versions are identical.<span class="tempdisplaynone"> Consultant Gerry Leonidas says that, “in many ways, the first Minion Pro set the reference point for a whole series of subsequent modulated Greek typefaces.”</span></p>
